# Test Task for Ninsar Games (Unity Developer)

The project's main objective is to implement two-dimensional array wrapping. This feature allows for the seamless movement of a 3x3 grid across the source data array. Each cell contains a color ID that corresponds to a specific color defined in `Assets/Resources/ColoristConfig.asset`.
